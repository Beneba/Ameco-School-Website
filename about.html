            <h4>History Background </h4>
              <p>The  Evangelical  Presbyterian  College  of Education  was  opened  on  10th  February,  1946  by  the  E. P. Church.   <br> The College was started by Rev. W. M.  Beveridge   of  blessed  memory,  a  Scottish  missionary  who  was  by  then  the  supervisor  of  Schools.   He  served  as  the  first  Principal  between  1946  and  1962,  a  period  of  16  years,  and  left  behind  a  rich  professional  legacy  and  a  strong  Christian  tradition  are  so  ingrained  in  every  AMECO  trained  teacher  that  he  or  she  is  easily  identified  in  the  field.    <br>

               <p>The  young  College  which  started  as  a  male  institution  with  an  initial  teaching  staff  of  six,  went  co-educational  in  January,  1950   when  20  females  teacher trainees  were  admitted  along-side  40 men.    The  College  was initially opened  as  a  2-year  Certificate  'B'  teacher  training  College  and  was  called  E. P.  Training College, Amedzofe.   In  1962  the  4-year  Certificate  'A'  Programme  was  added  to  the  College.</p>
                
               <p>
              The  aim  of  the  founders  was  to  train  professional  teachers  who   will  be  posted  to  teach  in  the  primary  schools  and  middle  schools  in  the  country  with  a  sound  moral,  spiritual  and  professional  educational  background  in  the  true  Evangelical  Presbyterian  tradition.   The  College  went  through  numerous  transformational  changes  in  the  academic  curricular.</p> 
                <p> A  Specialist  Course  in  Home  Science  was  briefly  introduced  in  1974  but  later  transferred  to  Aburi.  The 4-Year Certificate 'A' course was also finally replaced by the 3- Year Certificate 'A' Post-Secondary Programme.</p>

              <p>Currently  all  Teacher  Training  Colleges  have  been  upgraded  into  Diploma  awarding  institutions  and  the  Evangelical  Presbyterian  College  of  Education  is  no  exception.     Teacher trainees  are  given  enough  time  to practice  using  the  methods  and  strategies  they  are  taught  in  the  on  Campus  Teaching  Practice  (OCTP)  in  their  second  year.  In the  third  year  they  are  sent  on  attachment  in  schools  where  they  will  practice  teaching  under  the  guidance  of  trained  mentors  who  are  the  headteachers  and  class  teachers, and link  tutors. </p>
            
              Academically  the  college  achieved  a  great  deal in items  of  manpower  development  for  Ghana. The  College  has  produced  an  enviable  list  of  over  8,000  dedicated  teachers  some  of  whom  have  become  heads  at  second  cycle  institutions,  district  and  regional  directors  of  Education,  Business-men  and  women,  Army  and  Police  Officers,  University  Lecturers  and  Professors,  Lawyers,  Politicians,  Reverend  Ministers  Local  and  International  Civil  and  Public  Servants.   Indeed,  AMECO  has  within  the  past  sixty  and  over  years,  justified  her  existence  and  fulfilled  the  dreams  and  aspirations  of  the  founding  fathers.
